# Leah's Neovim Configuration

There shouldn't be any prerequisites to cloning and using this configuration, it should just _work_.

Also, I used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) video by ThePrimeagen to set up this configuration. Of course, I added some other things that I wanted that he didn't have, but this was a really nice resource.

Good luck! :D
